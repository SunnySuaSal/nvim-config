# My personal NVIM configuration
So, I just starded learning Nvim and I'm starting to try new things, so
in case I screw up something (and I know I eventually will) at least
I have something more or less stable to back up to.

Wish me luck!

Oh yeah, I'm searching for a reliable, fast but most importantly fun and amusing text editor and development environment.

I primary write LaTeX, C/C++ and web development (HTML, CSS, JS, React).

Let's see how it goes!
